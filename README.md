# Notes for [Professor Ali Hajmiri's Circuit and Systems](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc7Gz02Znph_HU1I9STgC4Nv0aG_jdb8Z)

'heaviside-1' contains notes from lectures 16 to 24 which explains:
- The assumptions we make when we analyze linear, time-invariant systems
- How the Heaviside operator comes about
- Examples of using the Heaviside operator
- The motivation to develop a catalog for the operator
- The derivation of the complete catalog through examples
- Time delay and how that's factored into equations that use the Heaviside operator

'heaviside-2' contains notes from lectures 25 to 27 which explains:
- What to do with initial conditions on a system
- How to analyse the frequency response of a system with the Heaviside operator and how the operator relates to the Laplace Transform
